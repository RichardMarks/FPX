FPX
Useful classes for FlashPunk users
Created by Richard Marks ccpsceo@gmail.com

This project contains various classes and may be used freely as long as you give credit.

Give credit to "Richard Marks - www.ccpssolutions.com" in your project or your webpage, or something.
And, I'd love to get a copy of your game!


All classes are in the rmarks.fpx package so to use them add this to your import section of your code:

import rmarks.fpx.*;

The FPX.as3proj file is a FlashDevelop project.
The project will NOT build.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!
Hope this helps you!
